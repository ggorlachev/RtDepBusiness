abstract = {As clinical trials of Neutron Capture Therapy (NCT) are initiated in the U.S. and other countries, new treatment planning codes are being developed to calculate detailed dose distributions in patient-specific models. The thorough evaluation and comparison of treatment planning codes is a critical step toward the eventual standardization of dosimetry, which, in turn, is an essential element for the rational comparison of clinical results from different institutions. In this paper we report development of a reference suite of computational test problems for NCT dosimetry and discuss common issues encountered in these calculations to facilitate quantitative evaluations and comparisons of NCT treatment planning codes. Specifically, detailed depth-kerma rate curves were calculated using the Monte Carlo radiation transport code MCNP4B for four different representations of the modified Snyder head phantom, an analytic, multishell, ellipsoidal model, and voxel representations of this model with cubic voxel sizes of 16, 8, and 4 mm. Monoenergetic and monodirectional beams of 0.0253 eV, 1, 2, 10, 100, and 1000 keV neutrons, and 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 MeV photons were individually simulated to calculate kerma rates to a statistical uncertainty of <1\% (1 std. dev.) in the center of the head model. In addition, a “generic” epithermal neutron beam with a broad neutron spectrum, similar to epithermal beams currently used or proposed for NCT clinical trials, was computed for all models. The thermal neutron, fast neutron, and photon kerma rates calculated with the 4 and 8 mm voxel models were within 2\% and 4\%, respectively, of those calculated for the analytical model. The 16 mm voxel model produced unacceptably large discrepancies for all dose components. The effects from different kerma data sets and tissue compositions were evaluated. Updating the kerma data from ICRU 46 to ICRU 63 data produced less than 2\% difference in kerma rate profiles. The depth-dose profile data, Monte Carlo code input, kerma factors, and model construction files are available electronically to aid in verifying new and existing NCT treatment planning codes.},

  abstract  = "The use of a multileaf collimator in the dynamic mode to perform
               intensity modulated radiotherapy became a reality at our
               institution in 1995. Unlike treatment with static fields using a
               multileaf collimator, there are significant dosimetric issues
               which must be assessed before dynamic therapy can be
               implemented. We have performed a series of calculations and
               measurements to quantify head scatter for small fields,
               collimator transmission, and the transmission through rounded
               leaf ends. If not accounted for, these factors affect the
               delivered dose to the prostate by 5\%-20\% for a typical plan.
               Data obtained with ion chambers and radiographic film are
               presented for both 6 and 15 MV x-ray beams. The impact on the
               delivered dose of the mechanical accuracy of the multileaf
               collimator, achieved during leaf position calibration and
               maintained during dose delivery, is also discussed.",
